### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**witherScript/witherScript** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->
- I'm stoked on making code smells a practical thing and not just some pipe dream of non-technical architects
- Building an abstraction for the ARM Linux Kernel RE: scheduling policies
- ðŸ’¬ Hit me up if you want to co-refactor some open source features. 
Been eyeing -> Building a React tool to warn about memory leaks, extending EventEmitter to check for unfreed Event Listeners etc

 I love: C++, TypeScript, Python, HTMX, React, the Virtual DOM
 I am trying to love: Vanilla JS
